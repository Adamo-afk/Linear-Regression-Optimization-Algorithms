# Linear Regression using Optimization Algorithms
This project focuses on linear regression and various optimization algorithms. Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used for predicting numerical values based on input features. This project aims to explore and compare the performance of different optimization techniques such as Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Mini-batch Gradient Descent in finding the optimal parameters to better predict the outcome of the linear regression, thus enabling more accurate predictions and better generalization.
